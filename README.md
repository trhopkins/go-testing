# Hello world in Go, plus tooling

The goal of this repository is to get accustomed to some modern development
practices like containerized development, continuous integration, test-driven
development, and so on. This repository closely follows the [Docker
tutorial](https://www.docker.com/blog/containerize-your-go-developer-environment-part-1/) covering this topic.
Things to try:

- [ ] Golang for good tooling/ecosystem
- [ ] Dockerfile for containerized build environments
- [ ] Makefile for quick build scripts
- [ ] Unit tests for confirm correctness
- [ ] SonarQube for security and linting
- [ ] GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
